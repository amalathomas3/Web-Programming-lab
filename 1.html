<h3><u>The situation that lead to stress and how I handled it</h3></u>
<p> I had completed m degree in 2019.After that I joined for MSC CS in Kerala. But I had a technical problem of the date of the result publication when I received m marklist. So m admission got cancelled. At that time I was so tense. I talked to my mother and she told me that it's okay ou can study MCA in the next year. At that time I felt so relaxed and I am so thankful to my mother</p>
